## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report a vulnerability through an issue ticket. We typically respond in around 1-2 days.

If your vulnerability is accepted, expect an update with a fix ASAP.
If your vulnerability is declined, do not expect any new changes.

If you report a serious vulnerability, your name will be added to the *Security Guards* section of our README as a "reward".
